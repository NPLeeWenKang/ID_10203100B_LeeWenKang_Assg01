## Deliverables
---
1. What is the user's audience intent and purpose?

   This website is personal portfolio website. This means it contains some of many projects, ways to contact me and an "About Me" page. To apply for scholarships and my future job/education, I am able to showcase my projects on my website. This allows me to collade and easily showcase my projects and myself to my future employers or teachers. Therefore, the user audience intent of this website is to view and understand more about me, so that they are able to hire/enrol the best person they can.
2. Who is the website catering to? What value does it provide it's users?
   
    This website is catering for my future employeers and educational institute. This website allows them to understand more about me and my many projects. It allows them to determine if I am the right candidate to hire/enrol. To cater to them, I have designed the website to be easily navigated, mobile friendly, and have provided a "Contact Me" form where they are able to use their email to contact me. In addition in the footer area, I have provided my GitHub and LinkedIn link.
