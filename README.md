## Design Process
While designing this website, I had think of my "users" and how they would use and navigate the website. As a result, I tried to imagine and understand my "users" from their point of view.
Firstly, I identified some potential "users" that would browse my website, and why they would want to use my website.
1. As a scholarship interviewer, I would like to know more about the interviewee. These can include his past projects, a short description about himself or his thinking mindset. By knowing more  about the interviewee, I would be able to better judge if he will make use of the scholarship to it's fullest extent.
2. As a University , I would like to understand more about the student. I would like to know his past education institutes, some of his notable achievements and his past projects. This allows me to determine if he is passionate about the course and whether to accept his university application.
To ensure that the website was mobile friendly, I had to design and develop the website from a "Mobile First" perspective. This means that the mobile view is always the first priority. This ensures that the website is always mobile and PC friendly.
When I was drawing my wireframe using Adobe Xd, I had to ensure that both PC and mobile views where suitable and appropriate.<br/>
As a web developer, I have a personal "rule" I always follow. That "rule" is to always develop bit size code and always check and ensure that they contain no errors. By developing in this manner, it is easier to troubleshoot and error check, as it is easier to look and detect errors in a small chunk of code than a large chunk of code. This makes developing any software whether is it a website or a programme much easier and faster.

## Features
Since this is a personal portfolio website. I have implemented several features to ensure that the navigation is smooth and experience is great.<br/>
1. Viewing personal project / source code of project. In each personal project page, there is a link either to access the project or the project's Github page. One example is in the "Todo Master" project page. In that page I provided a link (https://todo-app-bb61a.firebaseapp.com/) that brings the user a place where the user can "experience" the project.
2. Another feature is to view each technology for each project. This allows users to click on the icons which brings them to the technology's branding page. One example is in the "Box With You" project page. At the bottom, it showcases the technologies used in that project. By clicking on the icon, the user will be brought to the technology's branding page. By clicking on the Firebase icon, the user will be brought to https://firebase.google.com/.<br/>

## Deliverables
1. What is the user's audience intent and purpose?

   This website is personal portfolio website. This means it contains some of many projects, ways to contact me and an "About Me" page. To apply for scholarships and my future job/education, I am able to showcase my projects on my website. This allows me to collade and easily showcase my projects and myself to my future employers or teachers. Therefore, the user audience intent of this website is to view and understand more about me, so that they are able to hire/enrol the best person they can.
2. Who is the website catering to? What value does it provide it's users?
   
    This website is catering for my future employeers and educational institute. This website allows them to understand more about me and my many projects. It allows them to determine if I am the right candidate to hire/enrol. To cater to them, I have designed the website to be easily navigated, mobile friendly, and have provided a "Contact Me" form where they are able to use their email to contact me. In addition in the footer area, I have provided my GitHub and LinkedIn link.
